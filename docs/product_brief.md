# Tender-to-Inspection Brief — Product Brief

## Purpose

Tender-to-Inspection Brief helps technical reviewers turn public construction tender excerpts into structured, source-traced review briefs.

The application provides a transparent first-pass review structure by identifying technical scopes, surfacing information gaps, suggesting follow-up questions, and linking detected domains to source evidence. It supports human technical review and does not make legal, regulatory, compliance, safety, or engineering decisions.

## Users and review need

Primary users are technical reviewers, inspection coordinators, and specialists preparing for an early tender, document, or design review.

They need to:

- understand the declared project scope;
- identify technical domains requiring attention;
- inspect supporting source evidence;
- highlight missing or unclear information;
- prepare focused follow-up questions;
- record and revisit decisions on persisted generated findings.

## Current workflow

The application accepts bundled public or synthetic excerpts and short public, non-confidential excerpts pasted into the Streamlit interface. Bundled results are persisted; pasted excerpts remain session-only.

Each generated brief contains a summary, technical scopes and review focus areas, information gaps, suggested questions, source-labelled evidence, fixed `low` baseline confidence, and a human-review-required marker.

For persisted bundled briefs, reviewers can record `accepted`, `rejected`, or `needs_follow_up` decisions with optional notes. Every saved change appends a history event without modifying the generated brief.

Persisted briefs can be downloaded as deterministic, versioned JSON containing document metadata, the linked processing run, the generated brief and source evidence, and the complete ordered reviewer-decision history.

## Boundaries

The application does not currently provide:

- complete tender-dossier ingestion or document management;
- BIM coordination, site-inspection records, or defect tracking;
- regulatory or compliance assessment;
- autonomous engineering decisions;
- persistent storage or reviewer decisions for pasted excerpts;
- reviewer identity, authentication, or simultaneous multi-user editing;
- general multilingual or semantic document understanding.

## Direction

Near-term priorities are:

- broader qualitative validation;
- a documented ingestion path for tender documents and PDFs;
- more capable extraction methods only when they can be evaluated against the transparent baseline.
